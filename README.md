# Neural Network implementation from scratch

**1. Introduction**

The goal is to create a neural network (i.e. a multilayered perceptron) that is capable of recognizing handwritten digits.  A collection of Training data is provided to train the network to recognize different peopleâ€™s handwriting.  The network is then be able to generalize its behavior such that it can correctly classify handwritten characters that it has not seen before, i.e. classify the provided Test set. The code implements the concept of perceptrons and their connections in a network, feeds forward the inputs, calculates the output function, calculates error, backpropagates error, and adjusts weights appropriately. Algorithm trains neural network using the provided training data, and tested using the provided test data.
